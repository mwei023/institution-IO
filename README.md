# migrate

__Database migrations written in Go. Use as [CLI](#cli-usage) or import as [library](#use-in-your-go-project).__

* Migrate reads migrations from [sources](#migration-sources)
   and applies them in correct order to a [database](#databases).
* Drivers are "dumb", migrate glues everything together and makes sure the logic is bulletproof.
   (Keeps the drivers lightweight, too.)
* Database drivers don't assume things or try to correct user input. When in doubt, fail.

Forked from [mattes/migrate](https://github.com/mattes/migrate)

## Databases

Database drivers run migrations. [Add a new database?](database/driver.go)

* [PostgreSQL](database/postgres)
* [PGX v4](database/pgx)
* [PGX v5](database/pgx/v5)
* [Redshift](database/redshift)
* [Ql](database/ql)
* [Cassandra / ScyllaDB](database/cassandra)
* [SQLite](database/sqlite)
* [SQLite3](database/sqlite3) ([todo #165](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/issues/165))
* [SQLCipher](database/sqlcipher)

### Database URLs

Database connection strings are specified via URLs. The URL format is driver dependent but generally has the form: `dbdriver://username:password@host:port/dbname?param1=true&param2=false`

Any [reserved URL characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters) need to be escaped. Note, the `%` character also [needs to be escaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_the_percent_character)

Explicitly, the following characters need to be escaped:
`!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `=`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `]`

It's easiest to always run the URL parts of your DB connection URL (e.g. username, password, etc) through an URL encoder. See the example Python snippets below:

```bash
$ python3 -c 'import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote(input("String to encode: "), ""))'
String to encode: FAKEpassword!#$%&'()*+,/:;=?@[]
FAKEpassword%21%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C%2F%3A%3B%3D%3F%40%5B%5D
$ python2 -c 'import urllib; print urllib.quote(raw_input("String to encode: "), "")'
String to encode: FAKEpassword!#$%&'()*+,/:;=?@[]
FAKEpassword%21%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C%2F%3A%3B%3D%3F%40%5B%5D
$
```

## Migration Sources

Source drivers read migrations from local or remote sources. [Add a new source?](source/driver.go)

* [Filesystem](source/file) - read from filesystem
* [io/fs](source/iofs) - read from a Go [io/fs](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS)
* [Go-Bindata](source/go_bindata) - read from embedded binary data ([jteeuwen/go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata))
* [pkger](source/pkger) - read from embedded binary data ([markbates/pkger](https://github.com/markbates/pkger))
* [GitHub](source/github) - read from remote GitHub repositories
* [GitHub Enterprise](source/github_ee) - read from remote GitHub Enterprise repositories
* [Bitbucket](source/bitbucket) - read from remote Bitbucket repositories
* [Gitlab](source/gitlab) - read from remote Gitlab repositories
* [AWS S3](source/aws_s3) - read from Amazon Web Services S3
* [Google Cloud Storage](source/google_cloud_storage) - read from Google Cloud Platform Storage

## CLI usage

* Simple wrapper around this library.
* Handles ctrl+c (SIGINT) gracefully.
* No config search paths, no config files, no magic ENV var injections.

__[CLI Documentation](cmd/migrate)__

### Basic usage

```bash
$ migrate -source file://path/to/migrations -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

### Docker usage

```bash
$ docker run -v {{ migration dir }}:/migrations --network host migrate/migrate
    -path=/migrations/ -database postgres://localhost:5432/database up 2
```

## Use in your Go project

* API is stable and frozen for this release (v3 & v4).
* Uses [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies.
* To help prevent database corruptions, it supports graceful stops via `GracefulStop chan bool`.
* Bring your own logger.
* Uses `io.Reader` streams internally for low memory overhead.
* Thread-safe and no goroutine leaks.

__[Go Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4)__

```go
import (
    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/github"
)

func main() {
    m, err := migrate.New(
        "github://mattes:personal-access-token@mattes/migrate_test",
        "postgres://localhost:5432/database?sslmode=enable")
    m.Steps(2)
}
```

    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file"
)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "postgres://localhost:5432/database?sslmode=enable")
    driver, err := postgres.WithInstance(db, &postgres.Config{})
    m, err := migrate.NewWithDatabaseInstance(
        "file:///migrations",
        "postgres", driver)
    m.Up() // or m.Step(2) if you want to explicitly set the number of migrations to run
}
```

## Migration files

Each migration has an up and down migration. [Why?](FAQ.md#why-two-separate-files-up-and-down-for-a-migration)

```bash
1481574547_create_users_table.up.sql
1481574547_create_users_table.down.sql
```

# Institution OS

A multi-tenant school management platform for Kenyan primary and secondary
institutions, covering both the 8-4-4 and CBE (Competency-Based Education)
curricula. Built as a modular monolith: Go backend, Next.js frontend,
PostgreSQL.

**Status: pre-pilot.** Core student, academics, and finance workflows are
implemented and have been manually verified against real seeded data
(payments, grading, attendance, timetabling, authorization). This is **not**
yet production-hardened — see [Known Gaps](#known-gaps) before deploying
against real student data or real money.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Go, chi router, pgx (PostgreSQL driver), JWT (RS256) auth
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, `golang-migrate`-style versioned migrations
- **Payments:** M-Pesa Daraja (STK Push), sandbox-tested only

## Architecture

Modular monolith. Each domain (`academics`, `cbc`, `finance`, `student`,
`auth`, `communication`, ...) is its own Go package under
`backend/internal/`, following handler → service → repository layering.
Multi-tenancy is enforced by `institution_id` scoping on every table and
every query — see `docs/database_schema.md` and `docs/technical_architecture.md`
for the full design.

8-4-4 and CBE academics are deliberately **separate** packages (`academics`
and `cbc`) with parallel but non-shared tables, not a single polymorphic
schema — see the migration comments in `000009_create_cbc_academic_layer`
for the reasoning.

## Getting started

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DB connection, JWT keys, etc.
go run cmd/server/main.go

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Database migrations live in `backend/migrations/`, applied via
`golang-migrate` conventions (`<version>_<name>.up.sql` / `.down.sql`).

## Known gaps

This list is maintained by hand, not auto-generated — see project session
notes for the fuller, current version. Headline items as of this pass:

- **Test coverage is minimal.** Manual verification (curl + direct DB
  checks) has caught and fixed real bugs in payments, attendance, and
  grading authorization, but there is no automated regression suite
  protecting any of it yet.
- **HR, Boarding, Transport, and Clinic modules are schema-only** — the
  database tables exist; no handler/service/repository code or routes
  exist for any of them yet.
- **SMS and Email are architecturally wired but not connected to a real
  provider.** `ConsoleSMSProvider`/`ConsoleEmailProvider` log to console;
  swapping in a real provider (Africa's Talking, SendGrid, etc.) is a
  constructor-level change, not a rewrite, but hasn't been done.
- **M-Pesa integration is sandbox-only.** Real Daraja credentials are not
  yet in place, and `payment_channels.consumer_secret`/`passkey` are
  currently stored as plaintext — must be encrypted before any real
  credentials are entered.
- **`schema_migrations` does not reflect true database state** — needs a
  manual reconciliation pass before this is deployed anywhere new.
- **No `subject_enrollments` concept** — attendance and grading currently
  apply to every student in a class roster, not just students enrolled in
  that specific subject. Matters most for CBE senior-school electives.

See `docs/business_requirements_specification.md`,
`docs/technical_architecture.md`, and `docs/security_policy.md` for full
design documentation.
